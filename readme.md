# Oregon Trail Emulation Project

Based on an open source NES Emulator for Windows and Unix that features solid emulation accuracy and state of the art tools for power users. For some reason casual gamers use it too.

Some of capabilities of upgraded NES derived from OneBus NES-on-a-chip systems aren't compatible with regular nes and sometimes need a lot of hacking to separate them and keep in the same emulator both systems. So I need some kind of Sand Box to modify the emulator for my own and being able to have a working NES emulator at the same time.
